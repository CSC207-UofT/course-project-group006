##Introduction

An educational website that provides a platform for teachers and students to collaboratively learn vocabularies in other languages. As a dictionary, it allows people to search and translate words into many languages. But being an unusual dictionary, this website also helps to study the language by providing a word bank for the users to memorize. Teachers can form study groups and assign homework, quizzes and exams to the students within the group. Students may use the website to learn words by working on their own or join a study group and learn with other students.

//Other than learning the language through memorizing words, this website also serves as a dictionary. The website not only provides a great opportunity for students to find a teacher to help with their language learning studies but also gives the teachers the chance to meet and connect with some new potential students online.
